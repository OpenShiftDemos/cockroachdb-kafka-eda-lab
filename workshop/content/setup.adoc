. Login to the OpenShift console
+
Console URL: <auto generate>
+
Login id: <UserX>
+
Password: openshift (same for all users)

. Switch to Developer View
+
* In the OpenShift console's left-side menu, select the _Developer_ perspective
from the drop-down menu.
+
image::images/choose-developer-perspective.png[]
+
* Then, make sure to select the `userX-eda` from the drop-down menu labeled
_Project_ at the top-left.

## Fruit Shop Application
. Next, you will deploy a pre-built container image for the Spring Boot "Fruit"
application.
+
* Select _+Add_ in the left-hand navigation and then click the _Container Images_
tile.
+
* Enter `quay.io/ecosystem-appeng/spring-postgresql-demo:v0.0.1` in the box that
says _Image name from external registry_. Accept all of the other defaults and
click the blue _Create_ button.
+
* You will return to the _Topology_ view and see that the pod has a red ring
around it:
+
This is because the Spring application cannot find its database, so it crashes
on start-up. OpenShift keeps trying to restart the pod endlessly, which is a
good thing!

## CockroachDB Cloud Hosted Database
. Next, you will add a CockroachDB Cloud Hosted Database
+
* On the OpenShift console's left-side menu, select _+Add_ and then click the _Cloud-Hosted
Database_ tile. 
+
* Select _CockroachDB Cloud_ tile and then click the blue _Add to Topology_ button.
+
* In the next screen select _+ Create New Database Instance_ on the right-hand side.
[WARNING]
Make sure that you choose _+ Create New Database Instance_, otherwise you may
end up using someone else's database. This OpenShift cluster is configure with a
single database provider account for the CockroachDB Cloud, which is why you may
see all of the other databases.
+
* In the box that says _Cluster name_, enter `userX-db`.
* Scroll to the bottom and click the blue _Create_ button.
* Click the blue "View Database Instances" button.
* Click the radio button for your database, `userX-db`.
[WARNING]
Make sure that you select your own database, and not a different user's database.
* Click the blue _Add to Topology_ button.
* Click the blue _Continue_ button.
. Create a service binding between the Spring Boot Fruit Shop application and
the database instance.
* Hover your mouse over the center of the red pod ring. You will notice that a
small arrow appears coming out from the ring after a moment.
* Click and drag the arrow to the dotted-line box around the database.
* Click the blue _Create_ button to accept the default service binding name.
[NOTE]
A service binding in OpenShift automatically causes environment variables to be
set related to the service being bound. In your case, it is injecting
environment variables and details for the database connection.
* The pod ring should turn blue, indicating that the pod is now running (and no
longer crashing)

## Testing
. Test the Fruit Shop application
* Open Application UI by clicking the route opener (pictured)
* Perform basic tasks like inserts/updates within the application UI. For
  example, add 2 Strawberries.
. Obtain credentials to connect to CockroachDB Serverless cluster from Service
binding
* On the Topology page click on the Service Binding arrow:
* In the new right-hand panel, click on the link for the Secret:
* From the Service Binding Secret page, click the _Reveal values_ link
* Observe the values for various connection string parameters, but you will use
a little bash scriptlet to do the hard work for you.
* The `cockroach` CLI is embedded in the terminal. The following bash script will use `jq` to extract details from the secret, and then build the connection string:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
COCKROACH_DB_SECRET=`oc get servicebinding -o json | jq -cr .items[0].status.secret`
COCKROACH_DB_HOST=`oc get secret $COCKROACH_DB_SECRET -o json | jq -cr .data.host | base64 -d`
COCKROACH_DB_USER=`oc get secret $COCKROACH_DB_SECRET -o json | jq -cr .data.username | base64 -d`
----

* Execute the scriptlet using the following command, and note that it prints out the password you will need to type or copy/paste into the CLI:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
bash ~/scripts/test-service-binding.sh
----

* You will see output like the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
blahblah
----

* Validate the data was stored in the Database using basic SQL commands:
+
[source,sql]
----
select * from fruit limit 5;
----
