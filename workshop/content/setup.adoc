. Login to the OpenShift console
+
Console URL: <auto generate>
+
Login id: <UserX>
+
Password: openshift (same for all users)

. Switch to Developer View
+
* In the OpenShift console's left-side menu, select the _Developer_ perspective
from the drop-down menu.
+

+
* Then, make sure to select the `userX-eda` from the drop-down menu labeled
_Project_ at the top-left.

## Fruit Shop Application
. Next, you will deploy a pre-built container image for the Spring Boot "Fruit"
application.
+
* Select _+Add_ in the left-hand navigation and then click the _Container Images_
tile.
+
* Enter `quay.io/ecosystem-appeng/spring-postgresql-demo:v0.0.1` in the box that
says _Image name from external registry_. Accept all of the other defaults and
click the blue _Create_ button.
+
* You will return to the _Topology_ view and see that the pod has a red ring
around it:
+
This is because the Spring application cannot find its database, so it crashes
on start-up. OpenShift keeps trying to restart the pod endlessly, which is a
good thing!

## CockroachDB Cloud Hosted Database
. Next, you will add a CockroachDB Cloud Hosted Database
+
* On the OpenShift console's left-side menu, select _+Add_ and then click the _Cloud-Hosted
Database_ tile. 
+
* Select _CockroachDB Cloud_ tile and then click the blue _Add to Topology_ button.
+
* In the next screen select _+ Create New Database Instance_ on the right-hand side.
[WARNING]
Make sure that you choose _+ Create New Database Instance_, otherwise you may
end up using someone else's database. This OpenShift cluster is configure with a
single database provider account for the CockroachDB Cloud, which is why you may
see all of the other databases.
+
* In the box that says _Cluster name_, enter `userX-db`.
* Scroll to the bottom and click the blue _Create_ button.
* Click the blue "View Database Instances" button.
* Click the radio button for your database, `userX-db`.
[WARNING]
Make sure that you select your own database, and not a different user's database.
* Click the blue _Add to Topology_ button.
* Click the blue _Continue_ button.
. Create a service binding between the Spring Boot Fruit Shop application and
the database instance.
* Hover your mouse over the center of the red pod ring. You will notice that a
small arrow appears coming out from the ring after a moment.
* Click and drag the arrow to the dotted-line box around the database.
* Click the blue _Create_ button to accept the default service binding name.
[NOTE]
A service binding in OpenShift automatically causes environment variables to be
set related to the service being bound. In your case, it is injecting
environment variables and details for the database connection.
* The pod ring should turn blue, indicating that the pod is now running (and no
longer crashing)

## Testing
. Test the Fruit Shop application
* Open Application UI by clicking the route opener (pictured)
* Perform basic tasks like inserts/updates within the application UI. For
  example, add 2 Strawberries.
. Obtain credentials to connect to CockroachDB Serverless cluster from Service
binding
* On the Topology page click on the Service Binding arrow:
* In the new right-hand panel, click on the link for the Secret:
* From the Service Binding Secret page, click the _Reveal values_ link
* Get the details for the following values: username, host, clusterID (see below) & password:

Create connection string to connect to CockroachDB using CockroachDB Client
You will need to replace a few parameters in the command below with the values obtained from the :
cockroach sql --url "postgresql://<replace-with-username>@<replace-with-host>:26257/<replace-with-clusterid>.defaultdb?sslmode=verify-full"

From Terminal window, connect to CockroachDB Serverless using the CockroachDB Client
Use the completed connection string from the step listed above. Copy the connection string and paste it on your terminal window and press enter:

You will be prompted for the password, enter the password and press Enter to be successfully logged in:

Validate the data was stored in the Database using basic SQL commands:
Once logged into the CockroachDB SQL shell, run the following commands to confirm data was stored in the ‘fruit’ table:
First execute the following command: show tables;
Confirm that the fruit table was created. Then execute the following command: select * from fruit limit 5;
