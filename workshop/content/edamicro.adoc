## Accesing the sample application in Gitea
There is a Gitea application, which is an open-source Github-like solution,
running inside the cluster. You can access it at the following URL:

[source,role=copy]
----
%gitea_console_url%
----

Your Gitea username is:

[source,role=copy]
----
%gitea_user%
----

And the password is:

[source,role=copy]
----
%gitea_password%
----

Sign in to Gitea clicking the link at the upper-right.

When you sign in to Gitea, you will see that you already have a repository
staged for you, called `%user%/cockroach-kafka-eda`. Click into it now.

In preparation to do some light coding and process some Kubernetes/OpenShift
manifests, it will be necessary to clone this repository:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd ~;\
git clone %gitea_console_url%/%user%/cockroach-kafka-eda;\
cd ~/cockroach-kafka-eda
oc project %user%-eda
----

## OpenShift Pipelines and Pipeline resources
OpenShift includes a CI/CD solution, OpenShift Pipelines, that is based on the
upstream Tekton project. The repository you cloned includes some Pipeline
manifests for building your event-driven application source. Please create those
resources now:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f pipelines/tasks.yaml -f pipelines/pipeline.yaml
----

You will see output like the following:
[source]
----
task.tekton.dev/apply-manifests created
task.tekton.dev/update-deployment created
task.tekton.dev/create-cm created
pipeline.tekton.dev/build-and-deploy-ms created
----

[NOTE]
If you get an "already exists" error, it might mean you just executed the create
command twice. No worries!

. Now, go back to the OpenShift web console, making sure you are using the
`%user%-eda` project
. In the left-hand navigation, choose the _Administrator_ perspective at the
top.
. In the left-hand navigation, Click _Pipelines_
. Click _Tasks_

You should see the three tasks that you created:

[NOTE]
You can also find the tasks from the developer perspective by choosing _Search_
and then choosing the `Task` resource type, but this way is a little easier.

. Return to the _Developer_ perspective
. Click _Pipelines_

You should see the pipeline you created:

Click on the pipeline, and you will see a graphical depiction of the various
tasks and how they are ordered and their dependencies:

## Run the Pipeline
Now you will run the pipeline you created. While you could start the pipeline
run by clicking _Actions_ and then _Start_, the pipeline run requires a large
number of parameters to be set, and it's easier to do this from the command
line.

Go ahead and start the pipeline run with the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
tkn pipeline start build-and-deploy-ms \
-w name=shared-workspace,volumeClaimTemplateFile=pipelines/pipelinepvc.yaml \
-p deployment-name-p=eda-producer-ms-ep \
-p deployment-name-c=eda-consumer-ms-ep \
-p git-url=%gitea_console_url%/%user%/cockroach-kafka-eda.git \
-p IMAGE-P=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/%user%-eda/eda-ms-producer \
-p IMAGE-C=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/%user%-eda/eda-ms-consumer \
-p KAFKA_BROKER='crdb-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.crdb-kafka.svc.cluster.local:9092' \
-p KAFKA_GROUP_ID=%user%-groupid \
-p KAFKA_TOPIC=%user%-topic \
-p KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=%user%-clientid \
--use-param-defaults
----

. In the OpenShift web console, return to the _Pipelines_ menu
. Click the `build-and-deploy-ms` pipeline
. Click the _PipelineRuns_ tab
. Click on the pipeline run

You can now watch the pipeline do its thing. As each task completes, it will get
a green checkmark. If you click the _Logs_ tab, you can observe the log output
of each of the tasks.

While you're waiting for the pipeline run to finish, here's an explanation of
the `tkn` command above:

* Start the `build-and-deploy-ms` pipeline
* Use some shared storage, name it `shared-workspace`, and use a Kuberentes
volume claim based on the YAML to determine the size and other characteristics
of the storage
* The git URL for the source code
* The names of the producer and consumer resources
* The output destination for the built images in the OpenShift container image
registry
* Some parameters for the apps to talk to Kafka

The entire pipeline run may take six or seven minutes, so, if you're a fast
reader, now would be a great time to relax your eyes, stand up and stretch, or
play with your phone. We'll wait.

## Expose the deployed applications
Routes (and Kubernetes Ingresses) make applications available outside the
cluster. Go ahead and execute the following commands to expose the applications
you built and deployed with the pipeline:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create route edge --service=eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc -n %user%-eda
oc create route edge --service=eda-producer-ms-ep-svc -n %user%-eda
----

You will see output like:

[source]
----
route.route.openshift.io/eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/eda-producer-ms-ep-svc created
----

The `--edge` flag tells the command line tool to create a route that uses TLS
edge termination. This means that TLS encryption stops at the OpenShift router
(HAProxy) and is then un-encrypted between the router and the pod(s).

The following command will give you more details about one of the routes you
just created:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc describe route eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc
----

You will see output like:

[source]
----
Name:                   eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc
Namespace:              user1-eda
Created:                2 minutes ago

----

## Test the deployed producer
To test the producer, you will want to look at the logs. You can either do this
by visiting the OpenShift web console, or using the CLI. The lab guide will show
you the CLI version. 

In the web console's _Topology_ view, the producer application is called
`eda-producer-ms-ep`. Do you remember how to find the logs for its pod? If not,
look at the previous lab exercises.

Execute the following curl to hit the producer application:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl https://$(oc get route eda-producer-ms-ep-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/produce
----

You will see output like:

[source]
----
{"message": "Requested to produce sample messages on user1-topic topic" }
----

Now, check the producer logs:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc logs $(oc get pod -l app=eda-producer-ms-ep -o name)
----

You should see a bunch of references to the following:

[source]
----
produced to the topic user1-topic
----

## View the Consumer application
You can get to the routes for the various application components from the
_Topology_ view, or you can use the following command to get the URL:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get route eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc
----

You can copy/paste the hostname, and don't forget the HTTPS! Or you can use the following bash-fu:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc get route eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----

That's a lot of pears.

## Bonus Round! It's actually broken!
If you open the browser console, you'll see that the websocket connection that
the consumer application is making is failing. That's because the source code
has a hard-coded URL and doesn't use any kind of environment variable or other
parameter.

Take a look at the source code for the consumer webpage:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd ~/cockroach-kafka-eda
cat consumer/test.html | grep replaceme
----

It should be obvious what's wrong:

[source]
----
    webSocket = new WebSocket("wss://replacemewithconsumerurl/foo");
      fetch('https://replacemewithproducerurl/produce')
----

Now, ideally you would be using a dynamic application where the server would
interpret its environment variables and would determine the endpoint for the
websocket connection in real time before serving the page to the client.
However, this is a simple single-page HTML "application" so you'll have to
hard-code the websocket endpoint URL in the HTML file.

First, fix the consumer URL:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export CONSUMER_HOST=$(oc get route eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
sed -i "s/replacemewithconsumerurl/$CONSUMER_HOST/" ~/cockroach-kafka-eda/consumer/test.html
----

Then, fix the producer URL:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
export PRODUCER_HOST=$(oc get route eda-producer-ms-ep-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
sed -i "s/replacemewithproducerurl/$PRODUCER_HOST/" ~/cockroach-kafka-eda/consumer/test.html
----

Check your work:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
grep 'WebSocket|fetch' ~/cockroach-kafka-eda/consumer/test.html
----

You should see something like:

[source]
----
    //webSocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000/foo");
    webSocket = new WebSocket("wss://eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc-user1-eda.apps.cluster-rr4l2.rr4l2.sandbox1899.opentlc.com/foo");
      fetch('https://eda-producer-ms-ep-svc-user1-eda.apps.cluster-rr4l2.rr4l2.sandbox1899.opentlc.com/produce')
----

If you don't, feel free to use `vi` or `nano` to edit the `test.html` file
directly to fix things. Don't forget to save.

In order to commit your changes back to the git repo, you'll need to configure
the terminal's `git` client. The following can be used:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git config --global user.email "%user%@example.com"
git config --global user.name "%user%"
----

Then, commit your changes:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git add consumer/test.html
git commit -am "fixing websocket URLs"
----

Finally, push your code:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git push
----

Your Gitea username is:

[source,role=copy]
----
%gitea_user%
----

And the password is:

[source,role=copy]
----
%gitea_password%
----

Feel free to visit Gitea (using the URL at the beginning of the lab) to see
your changes. 

Now, you can trigger another pipeline run:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd ~/cockroach-kafka-eda
tkn pipeline start build-and-deploy-ms \
-w name=shared-workspace,volumeClaimTemplateFile=pipelines/pipelinepvc.yaml \
-p deployment-name-p=eda-producer-ms-ep \
-p deployment-name-c=eda-consumer-ms-ep \
-p git-url=%gitea_console_url%/%user%/cockroach-kafka-eda.git \
-p IMAGE-P=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/%user%-eda/eda-ms-producer \
-p IMAGE-C=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/%user%-eda/eda-ms-consumer \
-p KAFKA_BROKER='crdb-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.crdb-kafka.svc.cluster.local:9092' \
-p KAFKA_GROUP_ID=%user%-groupid \
-p KAFKA_TOPIC=%user%-topic \
-p KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=%user%-clientid \
--use-param-defaults
----

Return to the OpenShift web console to view the pipeline run's status. Note that
OpenShift will keep track of previous pipeline runs. This can be a very valuable
tool for debugging and/or understanding the quality, fragility, and overall
success of your CI/CD pipelines.

Revisit the consumer application:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc get route eda-consumer-ms-ep-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----

You should see the bars change after a few moments, and see no errors in the
browser console. Hit the "Produce Events" button, and you should see things
change in the bars.
